Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with Spring Cloud Stream.

`RestdocsTestApplicationTests` sends and receives a message twice. Two
snippets are produced automatically for each interaction. One showing the input (e.g. for "foo"):

include::{snippets}/foo/input-message.adoc[]

and one the output:

include::{snippets}/foo/output-message.adoc[]

The "foo" test also documents the fields on the input message:

include::{snippets}/foo/request-fields.adoc[]
