Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with Spring Cloud Stream.

`RestdocsTestApplicationTests` sends and receives a message. Two
snippets are produced automatically for each interaction. One showing the input:

include::{snippets}/processor/input-message.adoc[]

and one the output:

include::{snippets}/processor/output-message.adoc[]

The "processor" test also documents the fields on the input message:

include::{snippets}/processor/request-fields.adoc[]

It also creates a YAML contract specification for the processor (an
input message triggers an output message). This can be used by a
consumer of the contract to test its own interaction with the
processor. Here's an example (taken from the "consumer-sample" which
is a sibling to the "processor-sample"):

----
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids="com.example:processor-sample")              // <1>
public class ConsumerApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	@Qualifier(Processor.INPUT)
	private MessageChannel input;

	@Autowired
	@Qualifier(Processor.OUTPUT)
	private MessageChannel output;

	@Autowired
	private StubTrigger messages;                                         // <2>

	@Autowired
	private MessageCollector collector;                                   // <3>
	
	@Test
	public void exchange() throws Exception {                             // <4>
		assertThat(messages.trigger("processor")).isTrue();               
		input.send(MessageBuilder.withPayload(new Foo("foo")).build());
		assertThat(collector.forChannel(output).poll(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)).isNotNull();
	}

}

<1> autoconfigure the "stub runner" for simulating messages from "processor-sample"
<2> inject the `StubTrigger` from the Spring Cloud Contract stub runner
<3> the `MessageCollector` is from Spring Cloud Stream - it allows us to collect messages from the output channel
<4> a test method using the trigger and collector

In the test method, we activate the "processor" trigger, which sets up
the stub version of the "processor-sample" to expect an input
message. We then send the input message, which causes the stub to send
a message to the output channel. The consumer app uses
`@EnableBinding(Processor.class)` as a convenience to set up the
bindings to the two channels used by the processor.
